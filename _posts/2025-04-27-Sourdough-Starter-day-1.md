# Sourdough Starter Day 1

I am new to the world of sourdough, and was recently inspired by a friends journey in baking. 

This is my very first attempt at making / baking anything related to sourdough, so take anything I say with a gain of salt on the subject, atleast for now.

## The Starting Point
To begin this journey I need to successfully create a sourdough starter colony of natural yeast.

### Ingredients
- 50 grams of flour - Preferrably non bleached and whole grain. I used [Wholemeal Spelt Flour](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/335402/macro-organic-flour-wholemeal-spelt)
-  50 grams of water

### Method
- Add flour and water to a clean glass jar
- Mix until no dry flour is left
- Scrap down the sides with a spatula to reduce chance of mould growth
- Cover lightly and let sit at Room temperature

See you in 2 days for the next step in creating this starter culture.
